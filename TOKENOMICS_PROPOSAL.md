## 🔥 Burn Mechanisms (Deflationary Pressure)

Following industry best practices to prevent inflation:

### 1. Tournament Entry Fees (50% burned)
- Weekly tournament: 100 8BIT entry → 50 8BIT burned
- Monthly championship: 500 8BIT entry → 250 8BIT burned

- NFT badge sales: 2.5% fee burned
- Profile customization: All fees burned

### 3. Premium Features (75% burned)
- Username changes: 1,000 8BIT → 750 burned
- Special badges: 500 8BIT → 375 burned

### 4. Staking Penalties (100% burned)
- Early unstaking: Penalty burned

**Estimated burn rate:** 10,000-20,000 8BIT/day
**Net emission (Year 1):** 130,000-140,000 8BIT/day

## 🎮 Player Economics Example

### Casual Player (2 hours/day)
- Daily earnings: 280-1,250 8BIT (top 10 finish)
- Weekly tournament: 450-4,500 8BIT
- Monthly: ~20,000 8BIT potential

### Competitive Player (4+ hours/day)
- Consistent top 3: 600-1,250 8BIT/day
- Weekly wins: 3,000-4,500 8BIT
- Monthly championship: 4,500-10,500 8BIT
- Monthly: ~60,000 8BIT potential

### Token Value (Hypothetical):
If 8BIT = $0.01:
- Casual: $200/month
- Competitive: $600/month

## 📊 5-Year Projection

| Year | Daily Emission | Annual Emission | Circulating Supply | % of Total |
|------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 0 (Launch) | - | 160M | 160M | 16% |
| 1 | 150K | 54.75M | 214.75M | 21.5% |
| 2 | 130K | 47.45M | 262.2M | 26.2% |
| 3 | 110K | 40.15M | 302.35M | 30.2% |
| 4 | 90K | 32.85M | 335.2M | 33.5% |
| 5 | 70K | 25.55M | 360.75M | 36.1% |

**Notes:**
- Assumes team/investor vesting on schedule
- Doesn't account for burns (reduces supply)
- Ecosystem development released gradually
- Staking may lock 20-40% of circulating

---

## 🔐 Risk Mitigation

### Hyperinflation Prevention:
- Controlled daily emissions
- Automatic burn mechanisms
- Staking incentives
- Tournament entry requirements

### Market Volatility:
