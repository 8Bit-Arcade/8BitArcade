## What to Do with Your 8BIT

### Option 1: HODL (Hold)

**Keep earning and accumulating:**
- Token price may increase
- Future staking rewards (Phase 3)
- Deflationary pressure reduces supply
- Long-term value appreciation

**Benefits:**
- No gas fees
- No tax events (in most jurisdictions)
- Potential for higher future value
- Access to future features (staking, governance)

**Risks:**
- Price may decrease
- Opportunity cost vs selling
- No immediate cash benefit

---

### Option 2: Sell for Stablecoins

**Convert to USDC for cash-equivalent:**

1. Go to [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org)
2. Connect wallet (Arbitrum network)
3. Select: 8BIT → USDC
4. Enter amount to swap
5. Review price and slippage
6. Confirm swap
7. USDC appears in wallet

**Benefits:**
- Lock in profits
- No price volatility
- Stable value
- Can withdraw to bank

**Costs:**
- Gas fee (~$0.20)
- Swap fee (0.3% on Uniswap)
- Tax event (capital gains)

**Example:**
- Swap 10,000 8BIT
- Price: $0.0325
- Receive: ~$325 USDC
- Fees: ~$1.20 total
- Net: ~$323.80

---

### Option 3: Sell for ETH

**Convert to Ethereum:**

1. Same process as USDC swap
2. Select: 8BIT → ETH
3. Receive ETH on Arbitrum
4. Can bridge to mainnet if needed

**Benefits:**
- Exposure to ETH price
- Can stake ETH elsewhere
- May prefer ETH to stables

---

### Option 4: Use for Tournament Entry

**Spend 8BIT on platform (future):**

> ⚠️ **Coming Soon** - Not yet available

Planned feature to pay tournament fees with 8BIT:
- Use earned tokens for entries
- No need to buy USDC
- Circular economy
- May offer discounts

---

### Option 5: Stake for Passive Income

**Stake your 8BIT (Phase 3):**

> ⚠️ **Coming in Months 7-12**

When staking launches:
- Lock 8BIT to earn rewards
- 15-30% APY (estimated)
- Boost daily game rewards
- Governance voting power

*See [Staking Guide](../tokenomics/staking.md)*

## Selling on Uniswap

### Step-by-Step Swap Guide

**1. Prepare:**
- Have ~$1 worth of ETH for gas
- Know how much 8BIT you want to sell
- Check current price on Uniswap

**2. Go to Uniswap:**
- Visit [app.uniswap.org](https://app.uniswap.org)
- Click "Connect Wallet"
- Select MetaMask
- Ensure on Arbitrum One

**3. Set Up Swap:**
- From: 8BIT
- To: USDC (or ETH)
- Enter amount of 8BIT
- See estimated USDC/ETH received

**4. Check Details:**
- **Price:** Current exchange rate
- **Slippage:** Usually 0.5-1% (auto)
- **Minimum Received:** Worst case amount
- **Fee:** 0.3% Uniswap + gas

**5. Execute Swap:**
- Click "Swap"
- Review transaction in MetaMask
- Confirm
- Wait ~5 seconds
- Success! USDC/ETH in wallet

### Understanding Slippage

**Slippage** = Difference between expected and actual price

**Example:**
- You sell 10,000 8BIT
- Expected: $325 USDC
- Slippage: 1%
- Minimum: $321.75 USDC
- **If price drops >1% during transaction, swap fails**

**Settings:**
- 0.1% - Very low (may fail if market volatile)
- 0.5% - Recommended for normal conditions
- 1% - Safe for most situations
- 2%+ - High (only if necessary)

### Liquidity & Price Impact

**Price Impact** = How much your trade moves the market

**Example:**
- Pool has $100,000 8BIT liquidity
- You sell 10,000 8BIT (10% of pool)
- Price impact: ~5% (significant!)
- Better to split into smaller trades

**Best Practices:**
- Check price impact before swapping
- Keep impact under 1% if possible
- For large amounts, split into multiple trades
- Trade during high liquidity times

## Managing Large Amounts

### If You Win Big (100K+ 8BIT)

**Don't dump all at once:**

1. **Sell in tranches**
   - 10-20% at a time
   - Space out over days/weeks
   - Reduces price impact
   - Better average price

2. **Consider OTC (Over-The-Counter)**
   - For very large amounts ($10K+)
   - Direct buyer arrangement
   - Better pricing
   - Lower slippage

3. **Stake some, sell some**
   - Diversify strategy
   - Keep earning on staked portion
   - Cash out some for security

4. **Tax optimization**
   - Consult tax professional
   - May be advantageous to sell across tax years
   - Track cost basis

## Withdrawing to Fiat (USD/EUR)

### Converting to Bank Account Cash

**Route: 8BIT → USDC → Bank Account**

**Step 1:** Swap 8BIT to USDC (on Uniswap)

**Step 2:** Send USDC to centralized exchange
- Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc.
- Ensure they support Arbitrum USDC deposits
- Or bridge to Ethereum mainnet first

**Step 3:** Sell USDC for USD/EUR on exchange

**Step 4:** Withdraw to bank account
- Usually 1-3 business days
- May have withdrawal fees
- KYC verification required

**Alternative: Crypto Debit Cards**
- Crypto.com Card
- Coinbase Card
- Spend USDC directly
- Auto-converts at purchase

## Security Best Practices

### Protecting Your Earnings

**Wallet Security:**

- ✅ Never share seed phrase
- ✅ Use separate wallet for large holdings

**When Swapping:**
- ✅ Double-check token contract address
- ✅ Verify website URL (app.uniswap.org)
- ✅ Review transaction before confirming
- ✅ Start with small test transaction

**Avoiding Scams:**
- ❌ Never click suspicious links
- ❌ Don't trust DMs offering "help"
- ❌ Verify all token addresses
- ❌ Don't approve unlimited token spending

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see my rewards"

**Check:**
1. Ensure on correct network (Arbitrum One)
2. Add 8BIT token to wallet manually
3. Refresh wallet
4. Check transaction on Arbiscan
5. Wait 10 minutes (sometimes delayed)

### "Swap failed on Uniswap"

**Possible causes:**
- Slippage too low (increase to 1%)
- Insufficient ETH for gas (~$0.50 needed)
- Price moved too much (try again)
- Network congestion (wait and retry)

### "Rewards delayed"

**Reasons:**
- High network congestion
- Smart contract issues (rare)
- Platform performing maintenance

**Wait up to 1 hour, then:**
- Contact support
- Check platform status page
- Ask in Discord
