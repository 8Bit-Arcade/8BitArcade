## Tournament Strategies

### Strategy 1: Selective Entering

**Don't enter every tournament:**
- Choose games you're best at
- Enter when prize pool justifies risk
- Skip tournaments with too many participants
- Focus on events with less competition

### Strategy 2: Early Bird Advantage

**Enter and play early:**
- Set the pace with high score
- Psychological pressure on others
- More time to defend position
- See competition develop

### Strategy 3: Last-Minute Clutch

**Wait until final hours:**
- See what score you need to beat
- One perfect run can win
- Less time for others to respond
- High-pressure, high-reward

### Strategy 4: ROI Focus

**Calculate expected value:**

Example:
- $10 entry fee
- 100 participants = $500 prize pool
- You estimate 20% chance to place top 3
- Expected value = (Prize if win × Probability) - Entry fee

**Only enter when EV is positive.**

### Strategy 5: Practice First

**Before entering:**
- Play game extensively in free mode
- Know your skill ceiling
- Understand what score is competitive
- Enter only when confident
