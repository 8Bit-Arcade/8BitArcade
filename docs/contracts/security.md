# Security & Audits

## Protecting Your Funds and Ensuring Fair Play

Security is the foundation of 8-Bit Arcade. This page outlines all security measures, audits, and best practices to protect players and investors.

## Multi-Layer Security Approach

### Layer 1: Smart Contract Security

**Secure Development Practices:**

* ✅ Based on OpenZeppelin templates
* ✅ Standard ERC-20 implementation
* ✅ No complex/experimental features
* ✅ Extensively tested
* ✅ Peer-reviewed code

**Code Quality:**

* Solidity best practices followed
* No known vulnerabilities
* Gas-optimized
* Well-commented
* Unit test coverage >90%

***

### Layer 2: Access Control

**Multi-Signature Protection:**

* Critical functions require 3-of-5 multi-sig
* No single point of failure
* Transparent signer identities
* Public multi-sig address

**Protected Functions:**

* Minting new rewards
* Changing authorized contracts
* Treasury management
* Emergency procedures

***

### Layer 3: Economic Security

**Anti-Rug Pull Measures:**

* ❌ No team tokens unlocked at launch
* ❌ Cannot pause trading
* ❌ Cannot blacklist addresses
* ❌ Cannot modify max supply
* ✅ Liquidity locked 3-4 years
* ✅ Team allocation vested
* ✅ Transparent on-chain

**Deflationary Protection:**

* Burns are permanent
* Cannot be reversed
* Burn address has no private key
* Supply decreases provably

***

### Layer 4: Operational Security

**Platform Security:**

* HTTPS encryption
* DDoS protection (Cloudflare)
* Regular security scans
* Penetration testing
* Incident response plan

**User Data:**

* Minimal data collection
* No private keys stored
* Wallet-based authentication
* GDPR compliant
* Privacy-first design

## Common Security Risks & Mitigations

### Rug Pull Risk

**What it is:**

* Team drains liquidity
* Abandons project
* Investors lose everything

**Our Protection:**

* ✅ Liquidity locked (3-4 years)
* ✅ Team tokens vested
* ✅ Multi-sig controls
* ✅ Transparent operations
* ✅ No backdoors in code

***

### Honeypot Risk

**What it is:**

* Can buy token but can't sell
* Hidden restrictions in code
* Investors trapped

**Our Protection:**

* ✅ Standard ERC-20 (no modifications)
* ✅ No transfer restrictions
* ✅ Open source code
* ✅ Audited
* ✅ Tested selling before launch

***

### Flash Loan Attacks

**What it is:**

* Manipulate price with borrowed funds
* Exploit oracle/price mechanisms
* Drain value

**Our Protection:**

* ✅ No price oracles in core contracts
* ✅ Fixed tournament entry prices (in 8BIT tokens)
* ✅ No flash-loan-dependent logic
* ✅ Direct burn mechanism (no market dependency)

***

### Smart Contract Bugs

**What it is:**

* Coding errors
* Reentrancy
* Integer issues
* Unexpected behavior

**Our Protection:**

* ✅ OpenZeppelin base contracts
* ✅ Thorough testing
* ✅ Professional audit
* ✅ Bug bounty
* ✅ Gradual rollout

***

### Centralization Risk

**What it is:**

* Team has too much control
* Single point of failure
* Trust required

**Our Protection:**

* ✅ Multi-sig (not single owner)
* ✅ Immutable contracts (can't change code)
* ✅ Transparent actions
* ✅ Path to decentralization (Phase 4)
* ✅ Community governance planned

## User Security Best Practices

### Protecting Your Wallet

**DO:**

* ✅ Use hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor) for large amounts
* ✅ Write down seed phrase on paper
* ✅ Store seed phrase in safe place
* ✅ Enable wallet password/biometric lock
* ✅ Double-check website URLs
* ✅ Verify contract addresses

**DON'T:**

* ❌ Share seed phrase with anyone
* ❌ Save seed phrase digitally
* ❌ Click suspicious links
* ❌ Approve unlimited token spending
* ❌ Connect wallet to unknown sites
* ❌ Screenshot seed phrase

### Avoiding Scams

**Common Scams:**

**1. Fake Support DMs**

* Scammers pretend to be support
* Ask for seed phrase or private keys
* Official support NEVER DMs first

**2. Phishing Websites**

* Fake sites that look like 8-Bit Arcade
* Steal wallet info
* Always check URL: play.8bitarcade.games

**3. Fake Tokens**

* Scam tokens with similar names
* "8BIT" vs "8BIT-Token" vs "8Bit Arcade"
* Always verify contract address

**4. Airdrop Scams**

* Promise free tokens
* Require connecting wallet
* Drain funds when you approve

**Protection:**

* Bookmark official site
* Verify contract addresses
* Ignore unsolicited DMs
* Use [revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash) to check approvals

### Transaction Safety

**Before Confirming:**

1. Check transaction details in MetaMask
2. Verify receiving address
3. Verify amount
4. Check gas fee (reasonable?)
5. Confirm on correct network (Arbitrum)

**Red Flags:**

* Extremely high gas fee
* Unknown receiving address
* Unexpected token approvals
* Urgency/"limited time" pressure
