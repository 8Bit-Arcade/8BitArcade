# Connecting Your Wallet

## Set Up Your Web3 Wallet to Start Earning

To play 8-Bit Arcade and earn cryptocurrency, you need a Web3 wallet. This guide walks you through the complete setup process.

## What is a Web3 Wallet?

A **Web3 wallet** is a digital wallet that:
- Stores your cryptocurrency (like 8BIT tokens)
- Connects to decentralized applications (dApps)
- Signs blockchain transactions
- Proves ownership of your address

**Think of it as:** Your login + bank account for the blockchain.

## Recommended Wallet: MetaMask

**MetaMask** is the most popular Web3 wallet:
- ✅ Free and open-source
- ✅ Browser extension + mobile app
- ✅ Supports Arbitrum network
- ✅ Trusted by millions
- ✅ Easy to use

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Step 1: Install MetaMask

#### On Desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge)

1. Visit **[metamask.io](https://metamask.io)**
2. Click **"Download"**
3. Select your browser
4. Click **"Install MetaMask for [Browser]"**
5. Add extension to your browser
6. Pin extension for easy access

#### On Mobile (iOS/Android)

1. Download **MetaMask** from:
   - [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metamask/id1438144202)

2. **Write it down on paper** (do NOT save digitally)
3. Store in a **safe place** (fireproof safe, safety deposit box)
