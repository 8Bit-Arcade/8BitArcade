# Understanding Leaderboards

## How Rankings Work and How to Earn Rewards

Leaderboards are the heart of 8-Bit Arcade's reward system. Understanding how they work is essential to maximizing your crypto earnings.

## Leaderboard Basics

### What Are Leaderboards?

**Leaderboards** rank players by their highest scores in each game:
- Each game has its own separate leaderboard
- Top 10 players earn daily rewards
- Updated in real-time as players submit scores
- Reset every 24 hours at 00:00 UTC

### Per-Game Leaderboards

**Every game has independent rankings:**

- 🚀 **Space Rocks** → Top 10 earn rewards
- 🍒 **Chomper** → Top 10 earn rewards
- 🧱 **Block Drop** → Top 10 earn rewards
- 🎾 **Brick Breaker** → Top 10 earn rewards
- ... and all other games

**Key Point:** You can rank in multiple games simultaneously and earn rewards from each!

## Daily Reward Structure

### Top 10 Earnings Per Game

Every 24 hours, **50,000 8BIT** is distributed across all game leaderboards:

| Rank | % of Pool | Daily Reward | Monthly Potential |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **1st Place** | 25% | **12,500 8BIT** | **375,000 8BIT** |
| **2nd Place** | 12.5% | **6,250 8BIT** | **187,500 8BIT** |
| **3rd Place** | 12.5% | **6,250 8BIT** | **187,500 8BIT** |
| **4th Place** | 12.5% | **6,250 8BIT** | **187,500 8BIT** |
| **5th Place** | 12.5% | **6,250 8BIT** | **187,500 8BIT** |
| **6th Place** | 5% | **2,500 8BIT** | **75,000 8BIT** |

| **10th Place** | 5% | **2,500 8BIT** | **75,000 8BIT** |

### What This Means in USD

At a $10M market cap ($0.0325 per token):

- **1st Place:** $406/day = **$12,187/month** 🔥
- **2nd-5th Place:** $203/day = **$6,093/month**
- **6th-10th Place:** $81/day = **$2,437/month**

```

### How Rankings Are Determined

**Highest score wins:**
- Only your BEST score counts (not total/average)
- Unlimited attempts per day
- Play as many times as you want
- Score improves = ranking improves

**Tiebreakers:**
- If two players have same score
- Player who achieved score first ranks higher
- Encourages playing early and often

### Score Verification

All scores are verified on-chain:
- ✅ Submitted to blockchain
- ✅ Anti-cheat validation
- ✅ Timestamped and immutable
- ✅ Publicly verifiable

**Invalid scores are rejected:**
- Impossible scores (exceeds game limits)
- Modified game clients
- Automated bots
- Replay attacks

*See [Anti-Cheat System](../games/anti-cheat.md) for details*

## Daily Reset Cycle

### Reset Time: 00:00 UTC Daily

**What happens at reset:**

1. **Final rankings locked** for previous day
2. **Rewards calculated** for top 10 in each game
3. **Payouts distributed** automatically to wallets
4. **Leaderboards clear** for new day
5. **New competition begins** immediately

### Understanding UTC Time

- **UTC** = Coordinated Universal Time
- **00:00 UTC** = Midnight in London
- Convert to your timezone:
  - New York: 00:00 UTC = 8:00 PM (previous day)
  - Los Angeles: 00:00 UTC = 4:00 PM (previous day)
  - Tokyo: 00:00 UTC = 9:00 AM
  - Sydney: 00:00 UTC = 11:00 AM (next day)

**Check current UTC time:** [time.is/UTC](https://time.is/UTC)

### Reset Strategy

**Play near reset time:**
- Less time for others to beat you
- Reduces competition
- Strategic for securing top 10

**Play early in cycle:**
- Set the pace
- See what score to beat
- Multiple attempts throughout day

## Multi-Game Earnings

### Playing Multiple Games = Multiple Rewards

**Example: Rank in 3 games daily**

| Game | Your Rank | Daily Reward | Monthly |
|------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Space Rocks | 6th | 2,500 8BIT | 75,000 |
| Chomper | 4th | 6,250 8BIT | 187,500 |
| Block Drop | 8th | 2,500 8BIT | 75,000 |
| **TOTAL** | - | **11,250 8BIT** | **337,500** |

**At $1M market cap:** $1,096/month
**At $10M market cap:** $10,968/month

### Diversification Strategy

**Pros:**
- Multiple income streams
- Less dependent on one game
- More total earnings potential
- Spreads out competition

**Cons:**
- Requires skill in multiple games
- More time investment
- Divided focus

### Focus Strategy

**Master ONE game to rank #1 consistently:**

- 12,500 8BIT daily = 375,000 monthly
- At $1M mcap = $1,218/month
- At $10M mcap = $12,187/month
- Simpler, more focused approach
