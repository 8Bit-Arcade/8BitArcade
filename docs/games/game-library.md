## Game Selection Strategy

### For Beginners

**Start with:**
1. **Chomper** - Easiest to learn
2. **Brick Breaker** - Simple mechanics
3. **Pixel Snake** - Good skill progression

**Avoid:**
- Flappy Pixel (too hard initially)
- Space Rocks (complex controls)

### For Competitive Players

**Focus on:**
1. **Games you enjoy** (motivation matters)
2. **Medium difficulty** (less competition than easy)
3. **High skill ceiling** (practice advantage)

**Best combinations:**
- 1 easy game (consistent earnings)
- 2 medium games (competitive edge)
- Maybe 1 hard game (less competition)

### For Maximum Earnings

**Multi-game approach:**
- Play 3-5 games daily
- Rank 6th-10th in each
- Multiple smaller rewards > one big reward
- Diversification reduces risk

**Example:**
- Chomper: Rank 8th = 250 8BIT
- Brick Breaker: Rank 6th = 250 8BIT
- Pixel Snake: Rank 7th = 250 8BIT
- **Total: 750 8BIT/day** vs 1,250 for one #1 spot

## Game Mechanics

### Scoring Systems

**Most games use:**
- Points for actions (eating dots, breaking bricks)
- Multipliers for combos/power-ups
- Bonus for completing levels
- Penalties for deaths (in some games)

**Higher score ≠ Always better strategy:**
- Sometimes surviving longer matters
- Consistency > risky high-score attempts
- Study what actually ranks top 10

### Difficulty Progression

**All games get harder over time:**
- Speed increases
- More obstacles
- Fewer power-ups
- Pattern complexity

**Key to high scores:**
- Master early levels quickly
- Survive late-game difficulty spike
- Don't take unnecessary risks early
- Practice high-level gameplay

### Power-Ups

**Common power-ups across games:**
- **Speed Boost** - Temporary faster movement
- **Shield** - One-hit protection
- **Multi** - Double points or projectiles
- **Slow-Mo** - Slow down gameplay briefly
- **Extra Life** - One more chance

**Power-up strategy:**
- Save shields for late-game
- Use speed boosts to clear levels fast
- Catch multi-ball/multi-shot immediately
- Don't risk death chasing power-ups
