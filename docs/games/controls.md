# Game Controls

## Master the Controls for Better Scores

Understanding and mastering game controls is essential for competitive play and climbing leaderboards. This guide covers all control schemes and optimization tips.

## Universal Controls

### Keyboard (Recommended for Desktop)

**All games support keyboard controls:**
- More precise than mouse
- Faster response time
- Less hand fatigue
- Preferred by top players

### Mouse/Touchpad

**Limited support:**
- Some games allow click controls
- Less optimal for competitive play
- OK for casual gaming
- Not recommended for leaderboards

### Touch (Mobile)

**Mobile-optimized controls:**
- On-screen buttons
- Swipe gestures
- Tap controls
- Varies by game

## Game-Specific Controls

### 🍒 Chomper (Pac-Man Style)

**Keyboard Controls:**
```
↑ ← ↓ → Arrow Keys  - Move in 4 directions
W A S D             - Alternative movement
```

**How Movement Works:**
- Press direction to change movement
- Character keeps moving until you press another direction
- Can't reverse direction instantly (game mechanic)
- Pre-input next direction for smooth turns

**Pro Tips:**
- Use WASD for faster hand positioning
- Pre-press turns before corners
- Quick direction taps for dodging
- Arrow keys + WASD simultaneously doesn't work (choose one)

**Mobile:**
- On-screen D-pad (bottom-left)
- Swipe gestures for quick turns

### 🎾 Brick Breaker (Breakout Style)

**Keyboard Controls:**
```
← → Arrow Keys      - Move paddle left/right
A D                 - Alternative movement
Space               - Launch ball (start)
```

**How Movement Works:**
- Hold key for continuous movement
- Release to stop paddle
- Paddle speed is constant
- Ball angle depends on paddle hit position

**Pro Tips:**
- Feather keys for precise positioning
- Edge hits create sharper angles
- Center hits = straight bounce
- Quick taps for micro-adjustments

**Mouse Controls:**
- Move mouse left/right
- Paddle follows cursor
- Click to launch ball
- Better for some players (preference)

**Mobile:**
- Touch and drag paddle
- Tap to launch ball
- Swipe for quick movements

### 🐍 Pixel Snake (Snake Game)

**Keyboard Controls:**
```
↑ ← ↓ → Arrow Keys ONLY - Change snake direction
```

**How Movement Works:**
- Snake moves automatically
- Press arrow to change direction
- Can't reverse direction (180° turn)
- Input buffer (holds last key press)

**Pro Tips:**
- Press next direction early (buffered)
- Never spam keys (causes accidental reverse)
- Smooth direction changes
- One key press per turn

**Mobile:**
- Swipe in desired direction
- Single swipe = one direction change
- Don't swipe opposite direction

---

### 🧱 Block Drop (Tetris Style)

**Keyboard Controls:**
```
← → Arrow Keys      - Move block left/right
↑ or W              - Rotate block clockwise
↓ or S              - Soft drop (faster fall)
Space               - Hard drop (instant)
```

**How Movement Works:**
- Blocks fall automatically
- Rotate in 90° increments
- Can move/rotate while falling
- Hard drop ends turn instantly

**Pro Tips:**
- Use both hands (left for move, right for rotate)
- Space bar hard drop for speed
- Hold down for faster fall
- Rapid left/right for quick positioning

**Alternative:**
- Z/X for rotation (some players prefer)
- Can customize in settings (future feature)

**Mobile:**
- Swipe left/right to move
- Tap to rotate
- Swipe down for hard drop

### 🚀 Space Rocks (Asteroids Style)

**Keyboard Controls:**
```
↑ or W              - Thrust forward
← → or A D          - Rotate ship left/right
Space               - Shoot
```

**How Movement Works:**
- Ship has momentum (floats in direction)
- Thrust adds velocity
- Rotation doesn't affect current velocity
- Screen wraps (go off edge = appear on opposite side)

**Pro Tips:**
- Tap thrust (don't hold) for control
- Use rotation while coasting
- Shoot + thrust = rapid fire escape
- Master momentum physics

**Alternative Controls:**
- WASD only (↑ = W thrust)
- Arrow keys only
- Can't mix (choose one scheme)

**Mobile:**
- Left side: Thrust + rotate buttons
- Right side: Shoot button
- Or tilt to rotate (optional, in settings)

### 🐦 Flappy Pixel (Flappy Bird Style)

**Keyboard Controls:**
```
Space               - Flap wings (go up)
Click               - Alternative flap
```

**How Movement Works:**
- Character falls continuously
- Flap gives upward boost
- Gravity brings back down
- Precise timing required

**Pro Tips:**
- Rhythmic tapping (not random)
- Small taps for fine control
- Never hold space (one tap = one flap)
- Find your rhythm and stick to it

**Mouse:**
- Click anywhere to flap
- Same as spacebar

**Mobile:**
- Tap anywhere on screen
- Same mechanic as desktop

- Test on different browser
- Try different keyboard
- Check system performance

### When to Contact Support

**If controls:**
- Don't respond at all
- Randomly stop working
- Have severe delay (>100ms)
- Work inconsistently

**Troubleshooting first:**
1. Refresh page
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try different browser
4. Test keyboard elsewhere
5. Then contact support

## Control FAQs

**Q: Can I use a gamepad?**
A: Not yet. Gamepad support planned for Phase 3 (Months 7-12).

**Q: Can I customize key bindings?**
A: Not yet. Custom controls coming in future update. Join Discord to vote on priority.

**Q: Do I need a gaming keyboard?**
A: No, but it helps. Any keyboard works, gaming keyboards have lower latency.

**Q: Touch screen vs keyboard - which is better?**
A: Keyboard for competitive play. Touchscreen OK for casual.

**Q: My controls feel laggy, why?**
A: Try wired keyboard, close other tabs, update browser, or try Chrome/Brave.

**Q: Can I play with one hand?**
A: Some games yes (Flappy Pixel, Chomper), others harder (Block Drop, Space Rocks).

**Q: Do top players use special equipment?**
A: Most use standard gaming keyboards. Skill > equipment, but quality helps.

**Q: Controls stopped working mid-game, what happened?**
A: Browser lost focus. Click back on game window. Or page needs refresh.
