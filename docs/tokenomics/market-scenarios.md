### Realistic Timeline

Based on similar GameFi projects:

| Timeframe | Conservative Mcap | Moderate Mcap | Optimistic Mcap |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Launch (Week 1)** | $200K (2x) | $500K (5x) | $1M (10x) |
| **Month 1** | $500K (5x) | $1M (10x) | $5M (50x) |
| **Month 3** | $1M (10x) | $5M (50x) | $10M (100x) |
| **Year 1** | $5M (50x) | $10M (100x) | $50M (500x) |

## Comparative Analysis

### GameFi Market Caps (For Reference)

| Project | Peak Market Cap | Note |
|---------|----------------|------|
| Axie Infinity | $10B+ | Required $500+ investment to play |
| StepN | $5B+ | Required $200+ for shoes |
| DeFi Kingdoms | $1B+ | Complex DeFi mechanics |
| **8-Bit Arcade** | **TBD** | **FREE to play, simple games** |

**Key Difference:** 8-Bit Arcade requires **$0 investment** to earn. Lower barrier = higher adoption potential.

### Why $10M is Conservative

Consider:
- **Presale raise:** $100K
- **Market cap at $10M:** Only 100x the presale
- **Similar projects:** Often reach 1,000x - 10,000x
- **Free-to-play:** Massive addressable market
- **Proven games:** Not experimental mechanics

At $10M market cap with 300M+ circulating:
- Only $0.0325 per token
- Very modest for crypto gaming
- **Extremely achievable** target

## What This Means for You

### If You're a Player

Even at **conservative** market caps ($500K-$1M):
- Top daily players earn **$600-$1,200/month**
- Monthly tournaments worth **$800-$1,600**
- Weekly tournaments worth **$130-$260**
- **All completely FREE to enter**

At moderate market caps ($5M-$10M):
- **Life-changing income** from gaming
- **Better than most jobs** in many countries
- **Completely skill-based** - fair competition

### If You're an Investor

Presale entry at $0.0005 offers:
- **Low-risk entry point** ($100-$1,000 minimums)
- **High upside potential** (1,000x+ not impossible)
- **Real utility** from day one (not speculation)
- **Deflationary pressure** (buyback + burn)
- **First-mover advantage** (early GameFi on Arbitrum)

## Risk Considerations

These scenarios assume:
- ✅ Successful presale completion
- ✅ Strong player adoption
- ✅ Positive crypto market conditions
- ✅ Effective marketing execution
- ✅ No major technical issues
